                    <br>
                    My name is Elan, and I would like to help Complexly better connect with its viewers and provide them with the high-quality content they deserve.
                    I have served as a reviewer for multiple world-class research journals, ranking in the top 5% of reviewers at times.
                    In addition, I have co-authored 10 machine learning research publications.
                    Finally, I have four years of teaching experience.
                    Thus, I can accurately represent research to diverse viewers in a form they can engage with and inspire learning and curiosity.
                    <br><br>
                    My tertiary studies have given me a strong enough science background to publish academic works and serve as a volunteer reviewer for journals such as the International Conference on Machine learning.
                    In addition, I received multiple awards for my fact-checking and mentoring skills.
                    <br><br>
                    I have volunteer experience teaching students with significantly varying backgrounds and technical skills.
                    For example, I remember a class I gave on optimising neural networks where high school students sat next to machine learning engineers from Google.
                    I received excellent feedback on my ability to meet each class participant where they were.
                    In 2018 I helped organise an event where 300+ high school and university students came to learn from some of our country's best machine learning experts, free of charge.
                    <br><br>
                    I believe I am the right person for this job because I care about learning, creating curiosity in others and giving back to my community.
                    I can communicate and work effectively in a team and meet deadlines while working on many projects simultaneously.
                    <br><br>
                    I have engaged with so much of Complexly's content.
                    Dear Hank and John and the Anthropocene Reviewed remind me to be thoughtful and think of the world and the people in it more <span class="bold">complexly</span>.
                    SciShow (Tangents) and Bizarre Beasts feed my curiosity and remind me that the world is weirder, sillier, and more wonderful than I can imagine.
                    Crash Course and Ours Poetica have helped me understand the world around me and relate to others.
                    The Art Assignment reminds me that I would rather learn than be perfect.
                    Finally, I know that the Project For Awesome isn't a part of Complexly, but it helps me feel connected to others and like I'm a part of something bigger: a collective superhero that decreases world-suck one step at a time.
                    Complexly provides me with all of these experiences, and I would love to be a part of bringing people together and facilitating that for others.
                    <br><br>
                    Thank you very much for looking at my application.
                    I hope I can contribute to Complexly very soon.
                    I would love to discuss further how I can help and what makes me qualified to do so.

                <h5>What I think the greatest barrier to education is in 200 words</h5>
                <h1>Empathy</h1>

                <p class="lead">
                    Education is one of the most important things any individual can receive. According to
                    <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-education#social-returns-to-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our World in Data</a>,
                    a high level of education is strongly correlated to an individual's income and prosocial behaviours, such as feeling trust for others and participating in volunteer activities. Despite this, receiving a comprehensive education can be difficult.
                    <br><br>
                    I believe that the greatest barrier to education is a lack of empathy. More empathy would benefit many aspects of teaching and life in general. However, most significantly, we need systems to teach us to meet students where they are.
                    <br><br>
                    According to
                    <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-education#student-achievement-beyond-average-scores" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our World in Data</a>,

                    East Asian countries, such as Singapore, have higher percentages of high achieving students than Western countries, such as the USA. For example, 70% of students in Singapore are high achieving, contrasting to 45% in Northern Ireland (the highest scoring Western country).
                    <br><br>
                    According to the
                    <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/education/educating-future-case-east-asia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World Bank</a>,
                    East Asian countries focus heavily on teaching students to "know themselves", "relate well to others", and "how to learn". Thus, future teachers are empathic to their students, and current teachers show empathy by admitting: "we do not know what your future holds, so we will equip you with the tools to learn whatever you need".

                    <p class="lead">
                        I'm a curious and silly yet thoughtful person that loves
                        to learn and connect with others. I try to converse with
                        others, knowing that we perceive
                        the world differently and can still come together because
                        of the discussion instead of pulling apart. I try to
                        imagine the world and people in it complexly, and as a
                        consequence, I try to meet people where they are.
                        Teaching people is almost more about understanding what
                        they currently know and feel than what information I
                        think they need. I would much rather learn than be
                        perfect. I know the individual things I do to tackle the
                        world's big problems are entirely insufficient. Still, I
                        do them anyway, and I try to find others to do them with
                        because the only way we get anywhere is how we got here:
                        together.

                My tertiary education, 10 academic publications, and work as a research engineer during this time have taught me how to learn, and problem solve. In addition, these experiences gave me practice in researching, writing, editing, and fact-checking. Finally, I learnt to juggle multiple projects simultaneously, meet deadlines, and effectively communicate and work on a team.
                <br><br>
                I have spent time teaching, volunteering in places of learning, and serving as a reviewer for world-class academic journals. These experiences have taught me to understand students in order to meet them where they are, developed my mentoring skills, allowed me to create curiosity in others, and give back to my community.

                                While I worked on many projects during my graduate studies, my research focused on initialising noisy neural networks.
                                I co-authored multiple papers on this topic, but I described and expanded on that work in my thesis.
                                I give a 30 minute summary of my thesis in the following video.

                                We used mean-field theory to predict how the output of ReLU neural networks that use dropout and Gaussian noise would change due to initialisation.
                                As a result, we found a boundary on the maximum depth that these networks could be trained using those predictions.
                                Finally, we derived an initialisation that should allow one to train networks to the depth boundary.

                                To validate results from our previous work more thoroughly, we brought the idea of randomised control trials into this paper.
                                This also allowed us to test many different initialisation strategies and compare their performance to our own.
                                We trained over 12 000 neural networks and found that no other initialisation consistently outperformed ours.
