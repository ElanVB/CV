                <p class="lead">
                    My name is Elan, and I would like to help LifeQ conduct research and continue improving its clients' lives.
                    I have served as a reviewer for multiple world-class research journals, ranking in the top 5% of reviewers at times.
                    In addition, I have co-authored <a href="https://scholar.google.co.za/citations?user=jAHcMxMAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ten machine learning research publications</a>.
                    Finally, I have four years of teaching experience.
                    Thus, I can accurately represent research to diverse readers in a form with which they can engage.
                    <br><br>
                    My engineering and computer science degrees gave me strong technical skills. For example, I learned how to develop and validate effective mathematical models, algorithms, and code.
                    However, my communication skills were not as strong. So, I took the initiative to improve these skills by working as a freelance science communicator, where I also learned to convey complex ideas in an accessible way. That work and my master's studies also taught me to be self-directed and manage my time.
                    I learned to work on a team during my many research projects. These projects and my work as an academic reviewer also taught me to conduct literature and data-driven research and concisely communicate findings.
                    These experiences have made me confident that I can do almost anything given the time to learn.
                    <br><br>
                    I resonate with LifeQ's goal of empowering people to live healthier and happier lives by enabling them to make informed decisions.
                    I try to keep up to date with the latest health and research developments and learn about myself through my wearable. Despite this, I often feel that I do not have the information or insight to make decisions to improve my health and wellness.
                    Thus, I am excited by the products LifeQ offers. I think empowering people with tools to be in charge of their own health is fantastic. Remote monitoring of patients and insights from experts is a clever and effective use of specialised resources. Detecting and preventing illness is resource-efficient and improves the lives of the would-be patient.
                    I also appreciate LifeQ's stances of "honesty through validation" and "privacy is paramount". I want to help LifeQ continue to improve people's lives.
                    <br><br>
                    Thank you very much for looking at my application.
                    I hope I can contribute to LifeQ very soon.
                    I would love to discuss further how I can help and what makes me qualified to do so.

                            Critical initialisation for deep signal propagation in noisy rectifier neural networks

                        Stochastic regularisation is an important weapon in the arsenal of a deep learning practitioner.
                        However, despite recent theoretical advances, our understanding of how noise influences signal propagation in deep neural networks remains limited.
                        By extending recent work based on mean field theory, we develop a new framework for signal propagation in stochastic regularised neural networks.
                        <br><br>
                        Our noisy signal propagation theory can incorporate several common noise distributions, including additive and multiplicative Gaussian noise as well as dropout.
                        We use this framework to investigate initialisation strategies for noisy ReLU networks.
                        We show that no critical initialisation strategy exists using additive noise, with signal propagation exploding regardless of the selected noise distribution.
                        For multiplicative noise (eg. dropout), we identify alternative critical initialisation strategies that depend on the second moment of the noise distribution.
                        <br><br>
                        Simulations and experiments on real-world data confirm that our proposed initialisation is able to stably propagate signals in deep networks, while using an initialisation disregarding noise fails to do so.
                        Furthermore, we analyse correlation dynamics between inputs.
                        Stronger noise regularisation is shown to reduce the depth to which discriminatory information about the inputs to a noisy ReLU network is able to propagate, even when initialised at criticality.
                        We support our theoretical predictions for these trainable depths with simulations, as well as with experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10.

                        Recent work in signal propagation theory has shown that dropout limits the depth to which information can propagate through a neural network.
                        In this paper, we investigate the effect of initialisation on training speed and generalisation for ReLU networks within this depth limit.
                        We ask the following research question: given that critical initialisation is crucial for training at large depth, if dropout limits the depth at which networks are trainable, does initialising critically still matter?
                        <br><br>
                        We conduct a large-scale controlled experiment, and perform a statistical analysis of over 12000 trained networks.
                        We find that (1) trainable networks show no statistically significant difference in performance over a wide range of non-critical initialisations;
                        (2) for initialisations that show a statistically significant difference, the net effect on performance is small;
                        (3) only extreme initialisations (very small or very large) perform worse than criticality.
                        <br><br>
                        These findings also apply to standard ReLU networks of moderate depth as a special case of zero dropout.
                        Our results therefore suggest that, in the shallow-to-moderate depth setting, critical initialisation provides zero performance gains when compared to off-critical initialisations and that searching for off-critical initialisations that might improve training speed or generalisation, is likely to be a fruitless endeavour.

                        Recently, proper initialisation and stochastic regularisation techniques have greatly improved the performance and ease of training of neural networks.
                        Some research has gone into how the magnitude of the initial weights impact optimisation, while others have focused on how initialisation affects signal propagation.
                        In terms of noise regularisation, dropout has allowed networks to train relatively quickly and reduced overfitting.
                        Much research has gone towards understanding why dropout improves the generalisation of networks.
                        Two major theories are (i) that it prevents neurons from becoming too dependent on the output of other neurons and (ii) that dropout leads a network to optimise a smoother loss landscape.
                        <br><br>
                        Despite this, our theoretical understanding of the interaction between regularisation and initialisation is sparse.
                        Thus, the aim of this work was to broaden our knowledge of how initialisation and stochastic regularisation interact and what impact this has on network training and performance.
                        Because rectifier activation functions are widely used, we extended new network signal propagation theory to rectifier networks that may use stochastic regularisation.
                        Our theory predicted a critical initialisation that allows for stable pre-activation variance signal propagation.
                        However, our theory also indicated that stochastic regularisation reduces the depth to which correlation information can propagate in ReLU networks.
                        We validated this theory and showed that it accurately predicts a boundary across which networks do not train effectively.
                        <br><br>
                        We then extended the investigation by conducting a large-scale randomised control trial to search for initialisations in a region that conserves input signal around the critical initialisation in the hopes of finding initialisations that provide advantages to training or generalisation.
                        We compare the critical initialisation to 10 other initialisation schemes in a trial that consisted of over 12000 networks.
                        We found that initialisations much larger than the critical initialisation provide extremely poor performance, while network initialisations close to the critical initialisation provide similar performance.
                        No initialisations clearly outperformed the critical initialisation.
                        Thus, we recommend it as a safe default for practitioners.

                        Multi-agent reinforcement learning has recently shown great promise as an approach to networked system control.
                        Arguably, one of the most difficult and important tasks for which large scale networked system control is applicable is common-pool resource management.
                        Crucial common-pool resources include arable land, fresh water, wetlands, wildlife, fish stock, forests and the atmosphere, of which proper management is related to some of society's greatest challenges such as food security, inequality and climate change.
                        <br><br>
                        Here we take inspiration from a recent research program investigating the game-theoretic incentives of humans in social dilemma situations such as the well-known tragedy of the commons.
                        However, instead of focusing on biologically evolved human-like agents, our concern is rather to better understand the learning and operating behaviour of engineered networked systems comprising general-purpose reinforcement learning agents, subject only to non-biological constraints such as memory, computation and communication bandwidth.
                        <br><br>
                        Harnessing tools from empirical game-theoretic analysis, we analyse the differences in resulting solution concepts that stem from employing different information structures in the design of networked multi-agent systems.
                        These information structures pertain to the type of information shared between agents as well as the employed communication protocol and network topology.
                        Our analysis contributes new insights into the consequences associated with certain design choices and provides an additional dimension of comparison between systems beyond efficiency, robustness, scalability and mean control performance.

                        The human imagination is an integral component of our intelligence.
                        Furthermore, the core utility of our imagination is deeply coupled with communication.
                        Language, argued to have been developed through complex interaction within growing collective societies serves as an instruction to the imagination, giving us the ability to share abstract mental representations and perform joint spatiotemporal planning.
                        <br><br>
                        In this paper, we explore communication through imagination with multi-agent reinforcement learning.
                        Specifically, we develop a model-based approach where agents jointly plan through recurrent communication of their respective predictions of the future.
                        <br><br>
                        Each agent has access to a learned world model capable of producing model rollouts of future states and predicted rewards, conditioned on the actions sampled from the agent's policy.
                        These rollouts are then encoded into messages and used to learn a communication protocol during training via differentiable message passing.
                        We highlight the benefits of our model-based approach, compared to a set of strong baselines, by developing a set of specialised experiments using novel as well as well-known multi-agent environments.

                        For our submission to the ZeroSpeech 2019 challenge, we apply discrete latent-variable neural networks to unlabelled speech and use the discovered units for speech synthesis.
                        Unsupervised discrete subword modelling could be useful for studies of phonetic category learning in infants or in low-resource speech technology requiring symbolic input.
                        <br><br>
                        We use an autoencoder (AE) architecture with intermediate discretisation.
                        We decouple acoustic unit discovery from speaker modelling by conditioning the AE's decoder on the training speaker identity.
                        <br><br>
                        At test time, unit discovery is performed on speech from an unseen speaker, followed by unit decoding conditioned on a known target speaker to obtain reconstructed filterbanks.
                        This output is fed to a neural vocoder to synthesise speech in the target speaker's voice. For discretisation, categorical variational autoencoders (CatVAEs), vector-quantised VAEs (VQ-VAEs) and straight-through estimation are compared at different compression levels on two languages.
                        Our final model uses convolutional encoding, VQ-VAE discretisation, deconvolutional decoding and an FFTNet vocoder.
                        <br><br>
                        We show that decoupled speaker conditioning intrinsically improves discrete acoustic representations, yielding competitive synthesis quality compared to the challenge baseline.

                        Research in NLP lacks geographic diversity, and the question of how NLP can be scaled to low-resourced languages has not yet been adequately solved.
                        "Low-resourced"-ness is a complex problem going beyond data availability and reflects systemic problems in society.

                        Despite immense improvements in MT over the past decade, MT is centered around a few high-resourced languages.
                        As MT researchers cannot solve the problem of low-resourcedness alone, we propose participatory research as a means to involve all necessary agents required in the MT development process.

                        To begin to address the identified problems, MASAKHANE, an open-source, continent-wide, distributed, online research effort for machine translation for African languages, was founded.
                        In this paper, we discuss our methodology for building the community and spurring research from the African continent, as well as outline the success of the community in terms of addressing the identified problems affecting African NLP.

                        Transformers have shown great promise as an approach to Neural Machine Translation (NMT) for low-resource languages.
                        However, at the same time, transformer models remain difficult to optimize and require careful tuning of hyper-parameters to be useful in this setting.
                        <br><br>
                        Many NMT toolkits come with a set of default hyper-parameters, which researchers and practitioners often adopt for the sake of convenience and avoiding tuning.
                        These configurations, however, have been optimized for large-scale machine translation data sets with several millions of parallel sentences for European languages like English and French.
                        In this work, we find that the current trend in the field to use very large models is detrimental for low-resource languages, since it makes training more difficult and hurts overall performance, confirming previous observations.
                        <br><br>
                        We see our work as complementary to the Masakhane project ("Masakhane" means "We Build Together" in isiZulu.)
                        In this spirit, low-resource NMT systems are now being built by the community who needs them the most.
                        However, many in the community still have very limited access to the type of computational resources required for building extremely large models promoted by industrial research.
                        Therefore, by showing that transformer models perform well (and often best) at low-to-moderate depth, we hope to convince fellow researchers to devote less computational resources, as well as time, to exploring overly large models during the development of these systems.

                        I'm a curious and silly yet thoughtful person that loves to learn and connect with others.
                        I try to communicate with others, knowing that we perceive the world differently and can still come together because of the discussion instead of pulling apart.
                        I try to imagine the world and people in it complexly, and as a consequence, I try to meet people where they are.
                        I would much rather learn than be perfect.
                        I know the individual things I do to tackle the world's big problems are entirely insufficient.
                        Still, I do them anyway, and I try to find others to do them with because the only way we get anywhere is how we got here: together.

                            learned about all parts of the workflow. -->
                            I have used libraries like PyTorch, Keras, and TensorFlow
                            to create and train custom models.
                            Other libraries like NumPy, SciPy and scikit-learn let me rapidly prototype ideas.
                            I have also used Bash to allow a 30 computer cluster to collaborate on and multi-thread experiments.
                            I have used Git for version control for over a decade.

                            In one of my projects we trained over 12 000 neural networks.
                            To make this possible I identified and optimised the main bottlenecks in the pipeline.
                            For instance, we used the code from some researchers at Google as a base for our experiments.
                            But, their code took almost 2 days to run on one of our computers.
                            So, I optimised their code until it took only 2 hours to run. -->

                            The simplest implementation that trained the 12 000 networks took over a month to complete.
                            Because we needed results more quickly than this, I wrote code to train multiple networks at the same time on each computer.
                            I also made the computers draw tasks from a shared queue.
                            This reduced the time it took to train all 12 000 networks to only a few days. -->

                                I designed the methodology and program flow for many of the projects I have been a part of.
                                I broke the process into steps.
                                This let me see which tasks could be completed at the same time and where the bottlenecks may be.
                                Doing so let me plan which parts of the code were most important to optimise.
                                For instance, the code to train multiple neural networks at the same time let us complete
                                experiments that would have taken months in under a week.
                                I also optimised python code that we borrowed from previous research so that it
                                took about an hour to execute, instead of the roughly 20 hours before.

                                I enabled each computer to run multiple experiments at the same time.
                                This is called "multi-threading".
                                I created multiple "threads" per computer and conducted an experiment on each thread.

                                Each computer keeps track of what it is busy with and the experiments it has completed.
                                Other computers then check if the experiment they want to conduct is already done or under way by another.
                                If so, it moves onto the next experiment.

                            <p class="desc">
                                To make sure our results were robust and general, I ran experiments on multiple data sets.
                                I often wanted to evaluate how accurately my theoretical predictions matched experiment results.
                                My first comparison method was usually to plot the predictions and results together and do a visual inspection.
                                <br><br>
                                For instance, the cyan lines in the below figure shows how deep we predict information can travel in neural networks.
                                The heatmap then shows how close information at each layer is to being lost through numeric under or overflow.
                                <br><br>
                                The dashed vertical line shows that information will travel arbitrarily deep if networks are initialised correctly.
                                I felt it was important to be able to compare this to what would happen if someone did not initialise their network correctly.
                                So, I depicted the depths of the 2 most common initialisations using more vertical dashed lines.
                                <br><br>
                                I took care to represent as much information as clearly as possible when visualising results.

                                There were also times when I wanted to learn more than the mean and standard deviation of measurements.
                                In cases like the figure below, I plotted the distribution of results and marked key statistics.
                                For instance, I marked the mean with a grey and white dashed line and marked (and ranked) all modes with black dashed lines.
                                I could then use this information to make conclusions like: "using dropout decreases the average performance of networks (if training time is not increased)", "Moderate levels of dropout increases both best and most likely performance of networks", and "when dropout levels are too high, network performance decreases".

                                I found that visual aids could help explain these processes.
                                The figure below is an example where I showed how I created a class of networks, randomly sampled network architectures from this class, and then ran multiple experiments on each sample.

                                In a few of my research projects I wanted to investigate how initialisation of networks affects their performance.
                                The space of possible initialisations has continuous dimensions, meaning that I could not test all possible cases.
                                So, I developed ways of testing certain parts of the space that would likely give important information.
                                I first made a graphical representation of this method, shown below.

                                The game was a blend of Tetris and colour matching games.
                                Whenever a player makes a group of at least 4 adjacent spheres of the same colour,
                                the group vanishes and sends spheres to the opponents space to block them.
                                Chains of groups vanishing in a single turn gives more points and sends more blocking spheres to the opponent.

                                We often need to trade memory usage for computation efficiency.
                                Because of this, I have learned a lot about data structures like queues, trees, graphs, and has tables (sets).
                                Using a data structure that matches the task usually lets us use a more computationally efficient and simple algorithm.

                                This is actually how I learned about reinforcement learning and then machine learning in general.

                In addition, these experiences gave me practice in researching, writing, editing, and fact-checking.
                Finally, I learnt to juggle multiple projects simultaneously, meet deadlines, and effectively communicate and work on a team.
                <br><br>
                I have spent time teaching, volunteering in places of learning, and serving as a reviewer for world-class academic journals.
                These experiences have taught me to understand students in order to meet them where they are, developed my mentoring skills, allowed me to create curiosity in others, and give back to my community.

                                We used mean-field theory to predict how the output of ReLU neural networks that use dropout and Gaussian noise would change due to initialisation.
                                As a result, we found a boundary on the maximum depth that these networks could be trained using those predictions.
                                Finally, we derived an initialisation that should allow one to train networks to the depth boundary.

                                To validate results from our previous work more thoroughly, we brought the idea of randomised control trials into this paper.
                                This also allowed us to test many different initialisation strategies and compare their performance to our own.
                                We trained over 12 000 neural networks and found that no other initialisation consistently outperformed ours.

                                                            <li>one must take regularisation strength into account when initialising neural networks that use noise regularisation;</li>
                                                            <li>using noise-regularisation limits the depth to which one can train neural networks;</li>

                                I then worked with the writers and other reviewers to make the submission as good as possible, even if it was not yet ready to be accepted to this journal edition.

                                Many of the submissions I reviewed focused on increasing the understanding of the foundational theories of machine learning.
                                For instance, some submissions investigated factors that affect the ability of models to make valuable predictions when given new data (

                                I also reviewed submissions related to learning behaviours and sequential decision-making (

               I love to move my body.
               So, when I'm not working I am usually rock climing, hiking, trail running, or swimming.
               I love to take photos and videos of these things to share my experiences with others.
               In the rare times when I'm not moving, you can find me reading a fantasy book or maybe creating some art (sketches, digital painting, writing, etc).
