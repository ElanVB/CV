                    My name is Elan, and I would like to help the Healthy Gamer Foundation conduct research to support the internet generation.
                    I have served as a reviewer for multiple world-class research journals, ranking in the top 5% of reviewers at times.
                    In addition, I have co-authored <a href="https://scholar.google.co.za/citations?user=jAHcMxMAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ten machine learning research publications</a>.
                    Finally, I have four years of teaching experience.
                    Thus, I can accurately represent research to diverse readers in a form with which they can engage.
                    <br><br>
                    I have experience with many aspects of producing a research paper.
                    First, I have designed the methodology for multiple studies.
                    I was careful to keep practical limitations and statistical analysis of the results in mind.
                    I also programmed code to execute experiments and analyse and visualise results.
                    Lastly, I was involved in the writing and editing the papers themselves.
                    <br><br>
                    My work as a volunteer reviewer for research journals has given me experience critically analysing research papers.
                    I ensured the methodology was sound and the conclusions matched the results of the experiments.
                    I also presented the strengths and weaknesses of each study.
                    Doing so allowed me to advise on how best to improve them.
                    Finally, I highlighted their limitations as readers need to know what claims we cannot make from a set of results.
                    <br><br>
                    I have engaged with so much of Dr K's content. The interviews have made me more empathic with others. I learned that we are all complex and full humans that suffer in our own ways.
                    Dr K's guide to mental health and the lectures has helped me learn more about myself. I learned how to identify emotions better and choose how to react to them.
                    Group coaching has helped me engage more meaningfully with others. I learned how to be there for others and understand what they are going through before asking them if I can help them.
                    Healthy gamer provided me with all of these experiences, and I would love to be a part of bringing people together and facilitating that for others.
                    <br><br>
                    Thank you very much for looking at my application.
                    I hope I can contribute to the Healthy Gamer Foundation very soon.
                    I would love to discuss further how I can help and what makes me qualified to do so.

   			<h5>Writing Examples</h5>
   			<h1>Lay Summaries of Research Papers</h1>

   			<p class="lead">
                Research papers allow researchers to convey nuanced ideas accurately and concisely.
                However, we often write them in a form that is challenging for the general public to understand.
                I believe many people would benefit from some papers also being written in a more accessible way.

                That is why I am currently working as a science communicator.
                I write summaries of research papers to share with the general public.
                The company I work for also translates our summaries into African languages.
                Our goal is to empower individuals in our community by giving them access to recent research in their language.

                <!-- I am currently working as a freelance writer.
                My role is to read research papers and summarise them into a form the general public can more easily understand.
                We send our summaries to our translators, and they translate them into 6 different African languages.
                We then share these summaries with the public.
                We are also creating a data set to train machine learning models to do all this for us. Our goals are to empower:
                (1) the average person with new information and
                (2) Africans to learn in their native language. -->

                <p class="lead">
                <!-- <p class="lead" style="font-size:x-large;"> -->
                    Researchers mapped the genetics of one of the parasites that cause malaria to track how different variants may be spreading across the globe. They say the parasite, Plasmodium vivax, likely originated in Africa.
                    <br><br>
                    Researchers previously thought that rates of malaria caused by this parasite were low. But, it seems that cases are dramatically increasing in East Africa and other parts of the world.
                    <br><br>
                    Plasmodium vivax (PV) malaria cases are usually not severe, but recent studies show that PV can lie dormant in people and repeatedly reinfect them, causing them to miss work. This, along with the need for repeated treatment, can slow economies.
                    <br><br>
                    In this study, researchers wanted to analyse the genetics of PV parasites detected at various places globally. This genetic and geographical data can help health authorities to limit the spread of PV and better treat malaria.
                    <br><br>
                    The researchers extracted DNA from finger-prick blood samples collected from patients with PV malaria in New Halfa and Khartoum, both in Sudan. They also used data from samples collected in other parts of Africa, South America, and Asia. They compared the samples to find similarities and differences across the locations.
                    <br><br>
                    The researchers found that the genetics of PV samples were generally more similar to other samples from the same continent. This means they could potentially tell where a sample came from based on its genetics.
                    <br><br>
                    Interestingly, they saw that samples collected in Africa were more genetically diverse than samples from other continents. In other words, samples collected in Asia, for example, were more similar to other Asian samples than African samples were to other African samples.
                    <br><br>
                    The genetic diversity in Africa suggests that PV came from Africa. They also saw that African samples were more similar to Asian samples than South American samples. This means people or animals infected with PV probably recently moved between Africa and Asia.
                    <br><br>
                    Mapping the genetics of a parasite in this way gives scientists insights into how the pathogen spreads to different locations.
                    <br><br>
                    The researchers say future studies could use this information to identify geographical characteristics, like mountains, that separate different PV variants.
                    <br><br>
                    The researchers that performed this study were based in Sudan, Eritrea, France, and the USA.

                <p class="lead">
                <!-- <p class="lead" style="font-size:x-large;"> -->
                    Researchers optimised existing computer-based climate models for East Africa to better predict how temperatures might increase by 2100. This information will help regional authorities plan for and adapt to climate change effects, like food shortages or natural disasters.
                    <br><br>
                    Average temperatures are rising due to global warming, causing more extreme weather events like droughts and floods, which in turn spreads disease and disrupts farming. Such unpredictable events make it challenging to plan and adapt to climate change, so researchers are working on models to better predict climate change.
                    <br><br>
                    In this study, researchers wanted to identify existing climate models that best predict changes in East Africa, specifically over the years 2021 to 2100.
                    <br><br>
                    The researchers fed temperature recordings from Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, and Rwanda into 13 existing computer-based climate models. The temperature recordings spanned the years 1970 to 2014.
                    <br><br>
                    They combined the 5 models that were the most accurate on other data from East Africa. They used this combined model to predict how the climate in East Africa will change over time until 2100. They made predictions for two different scenarios: one where no new policies are implemented to slow climate change, and the other where policies moderately slow it.
                    <br><br>
                    The researchers predicted that the average temperature in East Africa will increase slowly from 2021 to 2049, by 1 degree Celsius. But, they expected the temperature to increase faster from 2080 to 2100, by 2.4 to 4.4 degrees Celsius.
                    <br><br>
                    They also predicted that the average temperature will increase almost 3 times more quickly if no policies are introduced to slow climate change, compared to policies that might moderately slow climate change.
                    <br><br>
                    These findings identified the best existing climate models for East Africa, and the most accurate average temperature predictions for the region as of 2021. This information will help future researchers improve climate models and predictions tailored to this area.
                    <br><br>
                    The researchers suggest starting with improving the ability of the models to predict extreme weather events, like droughts and floods. They also say the accuracy of the models over complex terrain like mountains or lakes should be improved.
                    <br><br>
                    This study was done by researchers from Uganda, Rwanda, Morocco, and China.

                <h5>What I think the greatest barrier to education is in 200 words</h5>
                <h1>Empathy</h1>

                <p class="lead">
                    Education is one of the most important things any individual can receive. According to
                    <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-education#social-returns-to-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our World in Data</a>,
                    a high level of education is strongly correlated to an individual's income and prosocial behaviours, such as feeling trust for others and participating in volunteer activities. Despite this, receiving a comprehensive education can be difficult.
                    <br><br>
                    I believe that the greatest barrier to education is a lack of empathy. More empathy would benefit many aspects of teaching and life in general. However, most significantly, we need systems to teach us to meet students where they are.
                    <br><br>
                    According to
                    <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-education#student-achievement-beyond-average-scores" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our World in Data</a>,

                    East Asian countries, such as Singapore, have higher percentages of high achieving students than Western countries, such as the USA. For example, 70% of students in Singapore are high achieving, contrasting to 45% in Northern Ireland (the highest scoring Western country).
                    <br><br>
                    According to the
                    <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/education/educating-future-case-east-asia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World Bank</a>,
                    East Asian countries focus heavily on teaching students to "know themselves", "relate well to others", and "how to learn". Thus, future teachers are empathic to their students, and current teachers show empathy by admitting: "we do not know what your future holds, so we will equip you with the tools to learn whatever you need".

                    <p class="lead">
                        I'm a curious and silly yet thoughtful person that loves
                        to learn and connect with others. I try to converse with
                        others, knowing that we perceive
                        the world differently and can still come together because
                        of the discussion instead of pulling apart. I try to
                        imagine the world and people in it complexly, and as a
                        consequence, I try to meet people where they are.
                        Teaching people is almost more about understanding what
                        they currently know and feel than what information I
                        think they need. I would much rather learn than be
                        perfect. I know the individual things I do to tackle the
                        world's big problems are entirely insufficient. Still, I
                        do them anyway, and I try to find others to do them with
                        because the only way we get anywhere is how we got here:
                        together.

                In addition, these experiences gave me practice in researching, writing, editing, and fact-checking.
                Finally, I learnt to juggle multiple projects simultaneously, meet deadlines, and effectively communicate and work on a team.
                <br><br>
                I have spent time teaching, volunteering in places of learning, and serving as a reviewer for world-class academic journals.
                These experiences have taught me to understand students in order to meet them where they are, developed my mentoring skills, allowed me to create curiosity in others, and give back to my community.

                            </a></h3>
                            <p>
                                We used mean-field theory to predict how the output of ReLU neural networks that use dropout and Gaussian noise would change due to initialisation.
                                As a result, we found a boundary on the maximum depth that these networks could be trained using those predictions.
                                Finally, we derived an initialisation that should allow one to train networks to the depth boundary.

                                To validate results from our previous work more thoroughly, we brought the idea of randomised control trials into this paper.
                                This also allowed us to test many different initialisation strategies and compare their performance to our own.
                                We trained over 12 000 neural networks and found that no other initialisation consistently outperformed ours.
